## Description

The SMARTool is a free web resource for L2 learners of Russian that
implements findings of a learning simulation experiment and corpus
research to optimize the acquisition of Russian vocabulary and
morphology. Corpus data (Janda & Tyers 2018) reveals that for any given
Russian lexeme, only a few (usually 1-3) wordforms account for nearly
all attestations, while remaining wordforms are rare or unattested. Our
computational learning experiment shows that learning of Russian
inflection is best when training is restricted to high frequency
wordforms. The SMARTool builds on these findings for a basic vocabulary
of 3000 nouns, adjectives, and verbs culled from major textbooks and
other sources to represent levels A1, A2, B1, and B2 (CEFR scale). We
have identified both a) the three most frequent wordforms for each
lexeme (reducing the target number of wordforms to learn from 150,000 to
9,000) and b) the most typical grammatical constructions and
collocations that motivate each wordform. We have also created c)
corpus-based example sentences instantiating typical use.

Audio for all sentences (in both female and male voices) and English
translations are available at the click of a button. The SMARTool has
filters that facilitate searching by: a) CEFR Level, b) Topic (such as
время/time, еда/food, здоровье/health etc.), c) Analysis (such as
Ins.Sing, facilitating grammatical exercises), and d) Dictionary form.
